\vs{recheck the storyline and reframe where needed. Maybe stress more the security aspect and how TEE can help}

The data deluge imposed by a world of ever-connected devices, like the \emph{Internet of Things} (IoT), has fostered the emergence of novel data analytics and processing technologies to cope with the typical \emph{volume}, \emph{velocity} and \emph{variety} properties that characterize the big data era.
In particular, to support the continuous flow of information gathered by millions of IoT devices, data streams have emerged as a suitable paradigm to process data at scale.
However, as some of these data streams may convey sensitive information, stream processing requires to support end-to-end security mechanisms in order to prevent third-parties to access restricted data.

% Data streams are more and more predominant in today's era of big data.
% In the world of all-connected and the \emph{Internet-of-Things} (IoT), on market places, or elsewhere, data is continuously produced and consumed by a large diversity of stakeholders.
%The latest estimates predict a total of \vs{fill} TB/s to be analyzed efficiently and securely within the next 10 years.
% In this context, data streams are expected to be processed with a native support for reliability, scalability and security properties.
This paper introduces \SYS{}, our initial work on a middleware framework for developing secure stream processing in the Cloud.
\SYS{} supports the implementation, deployment and execution of stream processing tasks in distributed settings, from large-scale clusters to multi-tenant Cloud infrastructures.
In particular, \SYS{} adopts of message-oriented~\cite{mom}, responsive, resilient-to-faults middleware design.
Finally, it scales horizontally and vertically seamlessly \rp{SGX is limited in memory usage, which weakens the claim of vertical scalibity} \rr{I agree that vertical elasticity is hard to justify given the SGX constraints, unless we introduce a different kind of vertical scalability}.
%Its design This middleware is designed according to The Reactive Manifesto: it is responsive, resilient, elastic and message driven\cite{reactivemanifesto}.
Briefly, its design is inspired by the dataflow programming paradigm~\cite{uustalu_essence_2005}: the developer combines together several independent processing components (\emph{e.g.}, mappers, reducers, sinks, shufflers, joiners) to compose several processing pipes.
The framework integrates an abstraction of the required deployment infrastructure.
\SYS{} smoothly integrates with industrial-grade lightweight virtualization technologies (\emph{e.g.}, Docker~\cite{docker}).
%by deployment automation based on the Docker ecosystem
It aims to be secure: communication channels use the SSL protocol~\cite{freier2011secure} for data communication.
Finally, our design intends to exploit the secure processing capabilities offered by trusted hardware \emph{enclaves}, nowadays widely available into mass-market thanks to the introduction of Intel's \emph{Software Guard eXtensions} (SGX)~\cite{costan_intel} in the SkyLake processors~\cite{skylake}, therefore offering end-to-end security to the processed streams.
% and giving the ability to process datas in trusted enclaves by the integration of the Intel's Software Guard Extension (SGX) hardware.

A few mainstream solutions exist today for distributed stream processing.
\textsc{Reactive Kafka}~\cite{reactivekafka} allows stream processing atop of Apache \textsc{Kafka}~\cite{apachekafka}.
More recently, few open-source solutions (\emph{e.g.}, Apache \textsc{Spark Streaming}~\cite{apachesparkstreaming}, Apache \textsc{Storm}~\cite{apachestorm}, \textsc{Infinispan}~\cite{infinispan}) introduced APIs to allow developers to quickly setup and deploy stream processing infrastructures.
These systems rely on the \emph{Java Virtual Machine} (JVM)~\cite{lindholm2014java}.
However, SGX currently imposes a hard memory limit of 128\,MB to the enclaved code and data, at the cost of expensive encrypted memory paging mechanisms and serious performance leaks~\cite{pires_scbr:2016,brenner_securekeeper:_2016} when this limit is crossed.
\SYS{} therefore proposes a lightweight and low-memory footprint framework that can fully execute within SGX enclaves.
We detail our implementation choices in Section~\ref{sec:implementation}.

%But one of our goals is to find out a software technology that can run in a SGX enclave, and the memory of the latter is limited to 96MB for the Intel Skylake processor (the first and only processor including SGX currently)\cite{costan_intel}.
%If the application running inside an enclave needs more memory, an expensive encrypted memory paging mechanism then is used, causing serious performance leaks~\cite{brenner_securekeeper:_2016}.
To recap, our \textbf{contributions} are the followings: (i) the design of \SYS{}, (ii) some details of our reference implementation, and (iii) the results of our preliminary evaluation based on a real-world dataset.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.
The architecture of \SYS{} is described in Section~\ref{sec:architecture}.
Our implementation choices and an example of \SYS{} program are reported in Section~\ref{sec:implementation}.
Section~\ref{sec:eval} discusses on our preliminary evaluation with respect to throughput and scalability results.
Before concluding, we wrap up by briefly describing our future work in Section~\ref{sec:future}.
