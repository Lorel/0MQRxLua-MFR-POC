Data streams have taken an inescapable place in communication.
In the world of all-connected and the Internet of things, on market places, or elsewhere, datas are produced in an unlimited way.
Thus their processing requires to be reliable, scalable and even sometimes secured.
We are introducing \textsc{SecureStreams}, a middleware for developping data stream processings and executing them on distributed systems.
This middleware is designed according to The Reactive Manifesto: it is responsive, resilient, elastic and message driven\cite{reactivemanifesto}.
It is inspired by the dataflow programming paradigm, giving to the developer an easy way to implement a processing pipe.
It integrates an abstraction of the required infrastructure by deployment automation based on the Docker ecosystem.
Finally, it aims to be secured, using the SSL protocol for data communication and giving the ability to process datas in trusted enclaves by the integration of the Intel's Software Guard Extension (SGX) hardware.

Few mainstream solutions have already been implemented for distributed streams processing.
Akka Streams Kafka, also known as Reactive Kafka\cite{reactivekafka}, achieves this on top of Apache Kafka\cite{apachekafka}.
We could also quote  Apache Spark Streaming\cite{apachesparkstreaming}, Apache Storm\cite{apachestorm}, or even Infinispan\cite{infinispan}.
All these solutions are using the Java Virtual Machine for their runtime.
But one of our goals is to find out a software technology that can run in a SGX enclave, and the memory of the latter is limited to 96MB for the Intel Skylake processor (the first and only processor including SGX currently)\cite{costan_intel}.
If the application running inside an enclave needs more memory, an expensive encrypted memory paging mechanism then is used, causing serious performance leaks\cite{brenner_securekeeper:_2016}.
