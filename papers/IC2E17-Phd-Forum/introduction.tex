Data streams have taken an inescapable place in communication.
In the world of all-connected and the Internet-of-Things (IoT), on market places, or elsewhere, data is continuously produced and consumed. 
The latest estimates predict a total of \vs{fill} TB/s to be analyzed efificiently and securely within the next 10 years.
This stream processing requires to be reliable, scalable and secure.
This paper introduces \SYS, our initial work on a middleware for developping secure stream processings. 
\SYS supports the implementation, deployment and the execution of stream processing tasks in distributed setting, such as clusters of machines or research testbeds.
It is message-oriented\vs{add ref}, responsive\vs{what do you mean?}, resilient to faults.
Finally it is easy to scale horizontally and vertically\cite{reactivemanifesto}.
%Its design This middleware is designed according to The Reactive Manifesto: it is responsive, resilient, elastic and message driven\cite{reactivemanifesto}.
Briefly, its design is inspired by the dataflow programming paradigm\vs{add ref}: the developer combines together several independent processing components (e.g. mappers, reducers, sinks, shufflers, joiners, etc.) to compose several processing pipes.% an easy way to implement a processing pipe.
The framework integrates an abstraction of the required deployment infrastructure.
It smoothly integrate with industrial-grade lightweight virtualization technologies (e.g. Docker~\cite{}\vs{add ref}).%by deployment automation based on the Docker ecosystem
It aims to be secure: communication channels use the SSL protocol\vs{add ref} for data communication.
Finally, our design intends to exploit the secure processing capabilities offered by trusted hardware \emph{enclaves}, nowdays widely available into mass-market thanks to the introduction of Intel's Software Guard Extensions (SGX)\vs{add ref} in the SkyLake processors\vs{add ref}.
% and giving the ability to process datas in trusted enclaves by the integration of the Intel's Software Guard Extension (SGX) hardware.

Few mainstream solutions have already been implemented for distributed streams processing.
Akka Streams Kafka, also known as Reactive Kafka\cite{reactivekafka}, achieves this on top of Apache Kafka\cite{apachekafka}.
We could also quote  Apache Spark Streaming\cite{apachesparkstreaming}, Apache Storm\cite{apachestorm}, or even Infinispan\cite{infinispan}.
All these solutions are using the Java Virtual Machine for their runtime.
But one of our goals is to find out a software technology that can run in a SGX enclave, and the memory of the latter is limited to 96MB for the Intel Skylake processor (the first and only processor including SGX currently)\cite{costan_intel}.
If the application running inside an enclave needs more memory, an expensive encrypted memory paging mechanism then is used, causing serious performance leaks~\cite{brenner_securekeeper:_2016}.
