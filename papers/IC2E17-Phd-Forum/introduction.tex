  \item Our aim: a high level framework for distributed processing of data streams
  \item Infrastructure abstraction
  \item Dataflow programming
  \item Reactive streams
  \item SGX integration (future work)
  \item Secure Data Stream: TLS communication? \url{http://curvezmq.org/} (future work)
  \item Nowadays, streams are everywhere: event streams (Your Mouse Is a Database), IoT, ...
\end{itemize}

Data streams have taken an inescapable place in communication.
In the world of all-connected and the Internet of things, on market places, or elsewhere, datas are produced in an unlimited way.
Thus their processing requires to be reliable, scalable and even sometimes secured.
We are introducing \textsc{SecureStreams}, a middleware for developping data stream processings and executing them on distributed systems.
This middleware is designed according to The Reactive Manifesto(ref): it is responsive, resilient, elastic and message driven.
It is inspired by the dataflow programming paradigm, giving to the developer an easy way to implement a processing pipe.
It integrates an abstraction of the required infrastructure by deployment automation based on the Docker ecosystem.
Finally, it aims to be secured, using the SSL protocol for data communication and giving the ability to process datas in trusted enclaves by the integration of the Intel SGX hardware.
