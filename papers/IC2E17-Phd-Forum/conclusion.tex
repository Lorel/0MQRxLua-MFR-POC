\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
Secure stream processing is becoming a major concern in the era of IoT.
This paper introduces our design and evaluation of \SYS, an easy-to-use and efficient framework to implement, deploy and evaluate stream processing pipelines for continuous data streams.
The framework is designed to exploit the Trusted Execution Environments nowadays available in Intel's processors such as the latest SkyLake.
We implemented the prototype of \SYS in Lua and based its APIs around the reactive programming approach.
Our initial evaluation results based on real-world traces are encouraging.
We plan to further extend and throughly evaluate \SYS in our future work.
