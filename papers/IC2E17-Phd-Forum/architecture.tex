  \item Why reactive?
    \url{http://www.reactivemanifesto.org/}
  \item Communication by Ã˜MQ (version 4.1.4)
  \item Docker container for clustered deployment
  \item Workers connected by routers: define worker's role and router's operating
  \item Fire-and-forget messaging: a messsaging pattern in which we do not expect a direct response to the message, as opposed to request-response protocols
  \item Based on Lua
