\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
Secure stream processing is becoming a major concern in the era of the Internet of things and big data.
This paper introduces our design and evaluation of \SYS{}, an concise and efficient middleware framework to implement, deploy and evaluate secure stream processing pipelines for continuous data streams.
The framework is designed to exploit the SGX \emph{trusted execution environments} readily available in Intel's commodity processors, such as the latest SkyLake.
We implemented the prototype of \SYS{} in \textsc{Lua} and based its APIs on the reactive programming approach.
Our initial evaluation results based on real-world traces are encouraging, and pave the way for deployment of stream processing systems over sensible data on untrusted public clouds.
% 
% We plan to further extend and thoroughly evaluate \SYS in our future work.
% In particular, we plan to extend \SYS with full automation of container deployments, as well as enrich the framework with a library of standard stream processing operators and efficient yet secure native plugins, to ease the development of complex stream processing pipelines.
